# Complete Deployment Guide

For a quick overview, see [quickstart](./quickstart.md).

This guide is split into two parts:

1. [Implementation](implementation.md) - How to initialise a Truffle project, import our
   library, define the required functions, and deploy your smart contract.
2. [Interaction](interaction.md) - how to interact with the system and acquire data in your
   smart contract once it has been deployed.
   
There is also a guide to the Finchains OoO API:

[Finchains OoO Data API Guide](ooo_api.md) - a guide to requesting data from the Finchains
   OoO API.
